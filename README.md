$\Rightarrow$ I examined the housing data set of an unknown neighbourhood. The examples of the data 
are  home communities by coordinates, for preventing misunderstanding : They are not 
houses as a single.

$\Rightarrow$ My hypothesis is increasing family member in same house by increasing wealth condition.

$\hspace{1cm}$

$\Rightarrow$ I did exploratary data analysis and some data visiualizations at the begining, then i 
created machine learning models to predict housing values by it's features. I chose the best and tuned
it.

$\hspace{1cm}$

$\Rightarrow$As a conclusion, it seems that best model to fit this data is XGBOOST Regressor but the data isn't 
sufficent for predicting values because of consisting less features. To recall my hyphothesis, 
according the histograms, it is true.
